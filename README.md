# Kweyu_FE_UI-Developer-Challenge
This is a technical challenge that involves creating two pages (Landing page and profile page) for a dating site using React Js with typescript and Bootstrap 5.

Pages
1. Landing Page:
Captive display of available profiles for easy navigation.
Each profile has a link/button that navigates to the corresponding Profile Page.

2. Profile Page:
Displays details about a given profile.
Includes image, age, location, bio, interests, height, relationship status, and what the profile is looking for.

Implementation Details
The project utilizes React/Next.js for front-end rendering.
Styling is achieved using Bootstrap 5 utility classes.
Profile data is fetched from a flat JSON file and used to populate the landing page and profile page.
The UI pulls and displays images stored as links in the JSON data.
